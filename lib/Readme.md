Here are all the external libraries for QOpenHD

(Github submodules)

Since QT is really bad at linking to non-qt libraries, we do not use any code / libraries we cannot build
diectly in this application (except ffmpeg / gstreamer for video)

NOTE on mavlink:

We use a custom mavlink flavour (openhd).
