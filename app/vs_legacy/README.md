Old stuff that no one understands except maybe stephen.
Mostly for platforms other than standart linux.
Before we re-introduce this code into QOpenHD, someone has to check if these (hacks ???!!) are still needed, if there are better solution(s)
nowadays and then re-implement this stuff.
Honestly, until someone takes this task upon him, we won't be able to compile QOpenHD for anything else than standard linux.
No one can maintain this old and undocumented code in its current state.
