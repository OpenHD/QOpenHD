/**
 * Changed: Used to have custom UDP and TCP stuff, but now just uses MAVSDK - MAVSDK already has both TCP and UDP support.
 *
 * @brief This is the one and only (mavlink telemetry) connection of QOpenHD to OpenHD
 * (More specific, the OpenHD Ground Station - but since the Ground station forwards messages to the air pi,
 * one can indirectly also reach the air pi via the ground pi, as well as the mavlink FC connected to the air pi).
 * Its functionalities are simple:
 * 1) sending mavlink messages to OpenHD
 * 2) receiving mavlink messages from OpenHD
 * 3) Handling the mavsdk "system discovery" for our OpenHD mavlink network, which is defined by
 *      a) OHD Air unit (own sys id)
 *      b) OHD Ground unit (own sys id)
 *      c) Optional FC connected to the air unit
